## Explanation ##
In this game, players will have the opportunity to pick our next President by answering some silly, non-political questions

## Here's how it's played: ##
- Player selects a candidate
- Player answers a series of questions, and the answers will determine if their candidate - or the other candidate - will win a Letter in their name (kinds of like playing a game of Horse in basketball)

## Rules: ##
- Get the question right, and score one letter in your candidate's name. 
- Get an answer wrong, and the other candidate will receive a letter.
- First candidate to have all the letters in their name will be your next President!

## Winner ##
- When a candidate has all letters in their name, they are pronounced the WINNER!

<!-- # Game

Game is a class

These are the attributes a Game should have:

  - `guesses` -> set to null
  - `guessedLetters` -> set to null
  - `words` -> set to null
  - `currentWord` -> set to null -->




<!-- Technical Requirements

Your app must:

Render a game in the browser
Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Use Javascript (jQuery optional... but not really suggested) for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it (gh-pages)


Necessary Deliverables

A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your GitHub repo
A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.


Suggested Ways to Get Started

Break the project down into different components (data, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
Use your Development Tools (console.log, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night
Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
Consult documentation resources (MDN, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
