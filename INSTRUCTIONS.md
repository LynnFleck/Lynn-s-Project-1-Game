## Explanation ##
In this game, players will have the opportunity to pick our next President by answering some silly, non-political questions

## Here's how it's played: ##
- Player selects a candidate
- Player answers a series of questions, and the answers will determine if their candidate - or the other candidate - will win a Letter in their name (kinds of like playing a game of Horse in basketball)

## Rules: ##
- Get the question right, and score one letter in your candidate's name. 
- Get an answer wrong, and the other candidate will receive a letter.
- First candidate to have all the letters in their name will be your next President!

## Winner ##
- When a candidate has all letters in their name, they are pronounced the WINNER!
- 

## Technologies Used ##
- This game was built with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript

## Unsolved Problems ##
I would like to resolve how to make the game work automatically, ie. when the player selects their candidate, they are asked questions until a winner is pronounced. I'd also like to create randomness to the questions/answers - currently, all the correct responses are in the index[1] spot :(
